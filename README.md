This project is a Unity Project that is meant to simulate how electromagnetic waves propagate through different mediums. The main point is to allow the user to edit parameters and play with numbers to change how the simulation works.
 
 The simulation uses the Finite Distance Time Domain method to simulate the waves and utitilizes Compute Shaders to offload the CPU load to the GPU. This method allows for extremely fast calculations and a higher resolution grid.
